As this website was targeting techies, it needed to fit all devices and browsers without compromising on design and functionality. SD Hacks incorporated a built in application system, with an accompanying administration panel and user pages. It also had a section for sponsors to filter and download participants’ resumes. All of this was built on top of a MEAN stack, utilising Heroku for the hosting."

However, this in-house system was too basic for their needs, and was no longer supported. Market Monitor was a more developed, customised version of their product for their mobile devices. It was built in Javascript on top of the Ionic libraries."

I initially contacted a designer to help me create a proof-of-concept [Twitch](https://twitch.tv) stream for an online game called [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh). This stream allowed players to queue up for their 30 seconds of fame, in which they would be able to play osu! in front of thousands of viewers. In this time, viewers could vote on whether they wanted to see more of this player, or move on to the next one. In just a few weeks we grew to 500+ daily viewers, peaking over 2,000 viewers on some days. The back-end system was built in Java, but utilises a Javascript and HTML front-end to overlay the game client."

This would allow them to keep their eyes on the game, yet still acknowledge and thank their generous viewers. The servers were built using Python, and the website was built in PHP on top of Laravel."

Since LoLAlerter was only for those partnered with [Twitch](https://twitch.tv), others who had not yet been partnered wanted an alternative that would do the same thing except, instead of notifying subscribers and donators, would notify followers. Due to being super simple to set up, and free to use, this too became heavily trafficked. Ultimately, LoLShadow was being run across 3 Python servers with a web interface built in PHP on top of Laravel."

It would periodically take a snapchat of your current statistics, and allow you to browse the growth of these statistics in the form of graphs and tables on the website.

All of the social media sections would update live, and the schedule, blog, poll and FAQ could all be updated by Mylixia from the administration panel. The website was built entirely in PHP on top of CakePHP, with jQuery used for front-end interactivity."
